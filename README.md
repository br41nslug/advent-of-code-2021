# Advent of Code 2021

My intention is to solve all challenges using a different programming language!

## Day 1
I'm starting of day one with two easy languages for me so i won't be tempted to use these for later challenges.
Day one i completed using both Bash and Python!

## Day 2
A colleague of reminded me that Excel can be considered a language too so why not.
I made this in google sheets then exported it to `.xlsx` and `.ods` for archiving purposes.
