# Advent of Code 2021

My intention is to solve all challenges using a different programming language!

Challenges completed in the following languages:
- Bash 5
- Python 3
- Excel (google docs, openoffice, excel)
- Rust
- Javascript (nodejs 16 environment)
- Go 1.17
- C# (dotnet 6.0)
- Perl 5 (strawberry perl)

## Day 1
I'm starting of day one with two easy languages for me so i won't be tempted to use these for later challenges.
Day one i completed using both Bash and Python!

## Day 2
A colleague of reminded me that Excel can be considered a language too so why not.
I made this in google sheets then exported it to `.xlsx` and `.ods` for archiving purposes.

## Day 3
Doing day 3 in a language i've been dying to try out, Rust.

## Day 4
Why not go with plain ol' Javascript for this one.

## Day 5
For today im going with a language i do not agree with on all design choices but hell it's still a damn useful language, Go.

## Day 6
An old friend will be used for today C# which you might consider my first language used for more "serious" applications.

## Day 7
I learned Perl at some point, to reverse some scripts i believe, and haven't really used it since but it can still be a very useful tool in my belt.
